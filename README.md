# Ember Practice

### Weather Ember App

Please build a simple Ember application that runs locally and displays a 5 day weather forecast for a given location "location key".

You can use https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/5day/%7BlocationKey%7D or another free weather api if you prefer. You can find more working location keys here https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/search

_Please use the latest version of Ember.js_

### Deliverable Details

- should show a 5 day forecast with date, weather icon, high/low temp and weather description i.e. "snow or light rain"
- should be able to update the location key with a text field and submit button
- should show loading state when new location key is submitted
- please add appropriate test coverage

We're living in a world where an increasing amount of users are accessing the web from a mobile device. Please design your layout to be mobile friendly as well as accessible from a normal laptop resolution.

### Deliverables

We're looking to see you can handle working within a JS framework - the fundamentals of designing data flow as well as component layout. However you decide to style is up to you - we're assessing your ability of CSS and markup, as well as best practices, not design skills.

Please share the project that is runnable locally.
